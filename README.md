# End-To-End-Cricket-Data-Analytics-Project


<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>
<p align="left">This repository contains the code and files for my Cricket Data Analytics Project. The project's primary goal was to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize cricket-related data to create an interactive and informative dashboard. The project encompasses various stages, including web scraping, data preprocessing, data modeling, and dashboard design using Power BI.</p>

<h2 align="left">Key Steps in the Project</h2>
<ol align="left">
        <li><strong>Web Scraping with Bright Data:</strong> I utilized Bright Data for web scraping to gather cricket-related data from various online sources. This data formed the foundation for my analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing in Jupyter Notebook:</strong> I performed data cleaning and transformation using Jupyter Notebook. This step involved handling missing data, resolving inconsistencies, and preparing the data for further analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Transformation with Power Query:</strong> In Power BI, I further refined the data using Power Query, ensuring it was in an optimal format for analysis and visualization.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Modeling with DAX:</strong> Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) were used to create custom calculations, measures, and parameters for advanced data modeling. This step allowed for more sophisticated insights and interactivity in the dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Dashboard Design with Power BI:</strong> I designed a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard includes interactive charts, tables, and visuals to present cricket statistics in an engaging manner.</li>
    </ol>

<h2 align="left">Features of the Dashboard</h2>
    <ul align="left">
        <li><strong>Player Analysis:</strong> The dashboard showcases the statistics of the top 11 cricket players in the world. Users can explore detailed player profiles, performance metrics, and historical trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Insights:</strong> Interactive visualizations provide insights into batting and bowling performance, historical records, and comparisons between players.</li>
        <li><strong>Parameterized Reports:</strong> The dashboard includes parameters that allow users to customize their analysis based on specific criteria, enhancing the dashboard's versatility.</li>
    </ul>
